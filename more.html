                            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere,
                            a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, 
                            in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
                            The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                            Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil.
                            But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.
